 * the camera reads these two angles and the player controller rotates its
 * movement input by the yaw, so looking around never moves the character and
 * moving never turns the camera.
 *
 * Pointer lock follows the PANEL state, not clicks:
 *
 *   gameplay        -> cursor hidden, mouse steers the camera
 *   a panel opens   -> lock released, cursor free for its buttons
 *   the panel closes-> lock retaken, camera resumes at once
 *   Escape          -> the browser releases; the lock is taken straight back
 *
 * A PANEL IS THE ONLY THING THAT SHOWS A CURSOR. Escape does not, and neither
 * does anything else: the browser forces the lock open on Escape and no page
 * can prevent that, so the release is treated as accidental and reversed. Two
 * things do the reversing, because neither is enough on its own - the lock is
 * re-requested, which browsers refuse for a moment after an Escape, and the
 * cursor is hidden in CSS meanwhile, which covers the gap until the player's
 * next keystroke or click makes the request stick.
 *
 * The player is never trapped: Escape still works at the browser's level every
 * time, and the shop and rebirth keys give a real cursor on demand.
 *
 * The lock is taken on the player's FIRST gesture rather than waiting for a
 * deliberate click on the world. A browser will not grant it without one, so
 * "automatic" can only mean "on the first thing the player does" - and since a
 * keypress counts, pressing W to walk is enough. There is no click-to-play
 * step.
 *
 * Shops are opened by key, not by clicking the world, so nothing here needs to
 * distinguish a click on a panel from a click on the game: while a panel is up
 * this source is suppressed outright.
 *
 * Touch look goes through the SAME accumulator via `addLookDelta`, so the
 * pitch limits, the yaw wrap and the suppression rule exist once and cannot
 * drift between the two devices.
